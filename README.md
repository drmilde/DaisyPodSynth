# DaisyPodSynth

First version of a polyphonic synth

I still am learning DaisySeed/DaisyPod. The code is running,
but is creating strange Midi glitches.

It might be, that I stress the microcontroller too much,
but the reference implementation 

(https://github.com/Nettech15/Daisy-Seed-8-Voice-VA-Synthesizer.git)

seems to be fine with 8 voices and 2 Oscillators.
